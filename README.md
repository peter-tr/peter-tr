### About Me
I'm Peter, a curious mind in the vast universe of software engineering, where every challenge is an opportunity to craft something extraordinary. From optimizing aviation software to diving deep into Rust and C++, my journey has been a relentless pursuit of knowledge and excellence.

When I'm not writing code, you might find me scaling cliffs, hitting the pavement for a run, or casting a line, always looking for the next big adventure.
